The number of restaurants in New York has been steadily growing, catering to students and working professionals with busy schedules. With such a fast-paced lifestyle, many rely on online food delivery services to enjoy quality meals from their favorite restaurants without leaving their homes or workplaces.

FoodHub, a food aggregator platform, connects users to a wide range of restaurants through a single app. Customers can place orders directly through the app, which notifies the restaurant and assigns a delivery partner to handle pickup and drop-off. Once the restaurant confirms the order, the delivery partner collects the food, delivers it to the customerâ€™s address, and updates the order status within the app. Customers can then rate their experience, and FoodHub earns revenue by taking a fixed commission from each order.

Objective
FoodHub has collected extensive order data from its registered users. As part of the Data Science team, the goal is to analyze this data to uncover insights about restaurant demand and customer behavior. These insights will help the company optimize operations, improve delivery efficiency, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
